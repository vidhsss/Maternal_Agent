        "question_translated": "My baby weighs 452 grams at 22 weeks...is this normal?",
        "answer": "\"Thank you for your question. According to the information provided, your baby's weight is lower than the average for 22 weeks. Typically, a baby at 22 weeks should weigh around 450 to 500 grams. However, every baby is unique and may not follow the exact growth pattern. It is important to monitor your baby's growth regularly through ultrasounds and prenatal check-ups. If you have concerns about your baby's weight, please discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can provide you with accurate information based on your specific situation and may recommend additional monitoring or interventions if necessary. In the meantime, ensure you are eating a balanced diet with plenty of nutrient-dense foods to support your baby's growth. This includes cereals, pulses, milk and milk products, cooking oils, nuts and oilseeds, and jaggery. Also, consider including calcium-rich foods such as milk, curd, paneer, ragi, sesame seeds, bathua leaves, and methi leaves in your diet. If you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.\"",

However, if you notice a significant decrease in your baby's movements or if you're concerned, it's important to consult your healthcare provider. They can check the baby's heartbeat and movement to ensure everything is okay. Generally, it's recommended to feel at least 10 movements in a day. If you're unsure, you can lie down on your left side for an hour, three times a day after meals, and count the number of movements. If the total number of movements in all three periods is less than 10, you should consult your healthcare provider. Remember, it's always better to be safe and seek professional advice if you have any concerns about your baby's movements.",

There are several causes of spotting that aren't worrisome, but some are. Bleeding that resembles your period isn't typical during pregnancy. Bleeding isn't always a sign that something is wrong, but heavy bleeding may mean there's a complication. Your pregnancy care provider will want to know what your blood looks like. Some details you'll want to track include:\n\nThe color of your blood: Is your blood brown, pink or bright red?\nThe consistency of your blood: Is it smooth, thick or watery? Does it contain clots or mucus?\nHow much blood there is: Did you see a few drops? Does it happen only when you wipe? Or are you filling a pad?\nThese details can help your provider determine the level of care you need and how urgent your symptoms are. It's always a good idea to call your provider so they can determine if the bleeding is serious.",

Underproduction of thyroid hormone leads to a condition called hypothyroidism. If a mother is taking medicine (artificial thyroid hormone) during pregnancy for low thyroid hormone production, then she should continue taking it during breastfeeding. This is important, both for her own health and lactation. The dose of the medicine may be adjusted by the doctor for maintaining adequate concentration of the thyroid hormone in your body. Mothers on treatment for hypothyroidism can successfully breastfeed. Very negligible amount of thyroid hormone including thyroid medicine is secreted in the breastmilk. It is absolutely safe to breastfeed while taking medicines for hypothyroidism. Infants born to mothers on hypothyroid treatment grow well and healthy on breastfeeding.

        "answer": "\"Thank you for sharing your concern. It's normal to experience nausea or vomiting during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. However, if you haven't experienced any vomiting, that's okay too. Every pregnancy is unique. Here are a few suggestions to help with nausea:\n\n1. Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day instead of three large meals.\n2. Avoid greasy, spicy, or fatty foods.\n3. Try eating bland or dry foods, like crackers or dry toast, before getting out of bed in the morning.\n4. Drink plenty of fluids, but try sipping them slowly throughout the day instead of gulping down large amounts at once.\n5. Ginger, in forms like tea or candies, can help reduce nausea.\n\nIf your nausea becomes severe, persistent, or is accompanied by other symptoms like fever, severe abdominal pain, or decreased urination, please contact your healthcare provider immediately. It's important to ensure that you and your baby are healthy.\"",
