Rich sources include green leafy vegetables, whole grains, cereals, dry fruits, nuts, meat, and jaggary.\n\n3. **Calcium**: Important for the baby's bone development. Sources include milk, milk products, sesame seeds, almonds, soya milk, turnip, and egg.\n\n4. **Vitamins**: Crucial for overall health and development. Sources include orange and dark green vegetables, citrus fruits, apple, tomato, amla, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, sunlight, milk and milk products, and soya products.\n\n5. **Fats**: Needed for energy and supporting growth.
