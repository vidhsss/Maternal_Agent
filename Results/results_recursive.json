For fever, Tab. Paracetamol 650 mg can be given up to four times a day. If the fever is not controlled with this, consider other drugs like NSAIDs (Tab. Naproxen 250 mg twice a day).\n\n2. **Warm Water Gargles and Steam Inhalation**: These can be performed twice a day to help relieve a cough and congestion.\n\n3. **Inhalational Budesonide**: If there is a persistent cough or fever beyond 5 days of illness, Inhalational Budesonide can be administered via DPI/MDI with Spacer at a dose of 800 mcg BD for 5 to 7 days.\n\nThese recommendations are based on the symptomatic treatment guidelines provided in the context. It is important to monitor the child's temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) regularly, as indicated in the self-monitoring chart (Figure 6) provided in the context.

According to the guidelines provided in the context:\n\n1. **Early Pregnancy (before 20 weeks)**: Bleeding could be due to various reasons such as a threatened or spontaneous abortion, an ectopic pregnancy, or a hydatidiform mole. \n   - **Threatened abortion**: The management might include activity restriction, but no medication is specifically required.\n   - **Incomplete abortion**: If it occurs up to 12 weeks, manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) is recommended to evacuate the uterus. If bleeding does not stop or the woman is in shock, intravenous fluids should be administered rapidly, and the woman should be referred to a medical officer with a referral slip.\n\n2. **Late Pregnancy (after 20 weeks)**: Bleeding during the second half of pregnancy should be considered as due to placenta previa unless proven otherwise, and vaginal examination is contraindicated as it may provoke heavy bleeding.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention if bleeding occurs during pregnancy to determine the cause and appropriate management.",
