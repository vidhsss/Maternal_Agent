Calcium Supplementation and Nutritional Intervention\n ∙\nThe calcium supplementation in pregnancy reduces incidence of pre-eclampsia and other hypertensive \ndisorders in pregnancy.\nIt is therefore important to take one tablet daily twice a day containing 500 mg of \nelemental calcium and 250 IU vitamin D3 started from 14 weeks of pregnancy upto six months post-partum.\n∙ One calcium tablet should be taken with the morning/afternoon meal and the second tablet with the evening/\nnight meal.\nIt is not advisable to take both calcium tablets together with iron because calcium interferes with \niron absorption.\nCalcium tablets should not be taken empty stomach since it causes gastritis.\n∙ Nutritional Intervention – Encourage the mother to include milk and milk rich foods in diet, fox tail millet \n(ragi), til, etc.\nd. Deworming\n ∙ Hook worm infestation also leads to iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women.\nIt is therefore important \nto take a single dose of 400 mg of Albendazole at second trimester of pregnancy.\nIt would be provided at \nVHSND by ANM and at HWC-SHC by CHO.\ne.

Calcium Supplementation and Nutritional Intervention\n ∙\nThe calcium supplementation in pregnancy reduces incidence of pre-eclampsia and other hypertensive \ndisorders in pregnancy.\nIt is therefore important to take one tablet daily twice a day containing 500 mg of \nelemental calcium and 250 IU vitamin D3 started from 14 weeks of pregnancy upto six months post-partum.\n∙ One calcium tablet should be taken with the morning/afternoon meal and the second tablet with the evening/\nnight meal.\nIt is not advisable to take both calcium tablets together with iron because calcium interferes with \niron absorption.\nCalcium tablets should not be taken empty stomach since it causes gastritis.\n∙ Nutritional Intervention – Encourage the mother to include milk and milk rich foods in diet, fox tail millet \n(ragi), til, etc.\nd. Deworming\n ∙ Hook worm infestation also leads to iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women.\nIt is therefore important \nto take a single dose of 400 mg of Albendazole at second trimester of pregnancy.\nIt would be provided at \nVHSND by ANM and at HWC-SHC by CHO.\ne. Malaria Prophylaxis and Treatment\n ∙\nNo prophylaxis is recommended, but insecticide-treated bed nets or Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN) \nshould be given on a priority basis to pregnant women in malaria-endemic areas.\nThese women should be \ncounselled on how to use the LLINs.\n∙\nIn high malaria-endemic areas, pregnant women should be routinely tested for malaria at the first antenatal \nvisit.\nScreen the woman for malaria every month by conducting the rapid diagnostic test even if she does not \nmanifest any symptoms of malaria.\n\n∙ If a pregnant woman shows symptoms of malaria at any time, she should be tested.\nIf the result is positive, \nrefer her to the PHC-HWC for treatment.\n\n2.

Examination\n ∙\nThis is similar to the examination conducted during the first visit.\nDuring second and third PNC visit for \nwomen who have undergone c-section, an examination of post-caesarean section surgical site for any signs of \nsurgical site infection like fever, purulent (pus) discharge in, or coming from the wound (including evidence of \nan abscess) or any reopening of the surgical wound or painful, spreading erythema surrounding the surgical \nsite should be noted and managed/referred accordingly.\nC. Management/counselling\nDiet and rest\n ∙ Inform the mother that during lactation, she needs to eat more than her normal pre-pregnancy diet.\nThis is \nbecause she needs to regain her strength during the period of exclusive breastfeeding and also for her baby to \nderive its full nutritional requirements from breast milk.\n∙ She should be advised to take foods rich in calories, proteins, iron, vitamins and other micro-nutrients (milk \nand milk products, such as curd and cottage cheese; green leafy vegetables and other seasonal vegetables; \npulses; eggs; meat, including fish and poultry; groundnuts; ragi; jaggery; fruits, such as mango, guava, orange, \nsweet lime and watermelon).\n54\n ∙\nShe should be counselled to consume one IFA and one calcium tablet each daily for at least 6 months after \ndelivery.\n∙\nThe taboos on food imposed by the family and community are usually stronger and greater in number in the \npost-partum period and during lactation than during pregnancy.\n∙ These should be enquired into, and the mother should be advised against following them if they are harmful \nto her and/or her baby.\n∙ The mother needs sufficient rest during the post-partum period; to be able to regain her strength.\nAdvise her \nto refrain from doing any heavy work during the post-partum period, and to focus solely on looking after \nherself and her baby.\nHer family members should also be advised to ensure this.\nContraception\n ∙ Inform the mother that whenever her periods begin again and/or she stops exclusive breastfeeding, she can \nconceive even after a single act of unprotected sex.",

Calcium Supplementation and Nutritional Intervention\n ∙\nThe calcium supplementation in pregnancy reduces incidence of pre-eclampsia and other hypertensive \ndisorders in pregnancy.\nIt is therefore important to take one tablet daily twice a day containing 500 mg of \nelemental calcium and 250 IU vitamin D3 started from 14 weeks of pregnancy upto six months post-partum.\n∙ One calcium tablet should be taken with the morning/afternoon meal and the second tablet with the evening/\nnight meal.\nIt is not advisable to take both calcium tablets together with iron because calcium interferes with \niron absorption.\nCalcium tablets should not be taken empty stomach since it causes gastritis.\n∙ Nutritional Intervention – Encourage the mother to include milk and milk rich foods in diet, fox tail millet \n(ragi), til, etc.\nd. Deworming\n ∙ Hook worm infestation also leads to iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women.\nIt is therefore important \nto take a single dose of 400 mg of Albendazole at second trimester of pregnancy.\nIt would be provided at \nVHSND by ANM and at HWC-SHC by CHO.\ne. Malaria Prophylaxis and Treatment\n ∙\nNo prophylaxis is recommended, but insecticide-treated bed nets or Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN) \nshould be given on a priority basis to pregnant women in malaria-endemic areas.\nThese women should be \ncounselled on how to use the LLINs.\n∙\nIn high malaria-endemic areas, pregnant women should be routinely tested for malaria at the first antenatal \nvisit.\nScreen the woman for malaria every month by conducting the rapid diagnostic test even if she does not \nmanifest any symptoms of malaria.\n\n∙ If a pregnant woman shows symptoms of malaria at any time, she should be tested.\nIf the result is positive, \nrefer her to the PHC-HWC for treatment.\n\n• The GDG noted that antenatal ultrasound is an intervention that can potentially be task shifted from \ntrained sonographers and doctors to trained nurses, midwives and clinical officers, provided that ongoing \ntraining, staff retention, quality improvement activities and supervision are ensured.\n• Stakeholders might be able to offset/ reduce the cost of antenatal ultrasound if the ultrasound equipment \nis also used for other indications (e.g. obstetric emergencies) or by other medical departments.\n•\nThe implementation and impact of this recommendation on health outcomes, facility utilization and \nequity should be monitored at the health service, regional and country levels, based on clearly defined \ncriteria and indicators associated with locally agreed targets.a \n• For further guidance, please refer to the WHO Manual of diagnostic ultrasound (119), available at:  \nhttp:/ /www.who.int/ medical_devices/\npublications/ manual_ultrasound_pack1-2/\nen/\nSummary of evidence and considerations\na) Effects of an ultrasound scan before 24 weeks \nof gestation (early ultrasound scan) versus \nselective ultrasound scan (EB T able B.2.4a)\nThe evidence on early ultrasound was derived from \na Cochrane review that included 11 RCT s conducted \nin Australia, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the \nUnited Kingdom and the USA, involving 37 505 \nwomen (120).\nThe intervention in all trials involved \nan ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation, \nwith women in the control arm undergoing selective \nscans if indicated (or, in one study, concealed \nscans, the results of which were not shared with \nclinicians unless requested).\nThe scans usually \nincluded assessment of gestational age (biparietal \ndiameter with or without head circumference and \nfemur length), fetal anatomy, number of fetuses and\n\nChapter 3.\nEvidence and recommendations \n59\nlocation of the placenta.\nScans were performed in \nmost trials between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation, \nwith three trials evaluating scans before 14 weeks, \nand three trials evaluating an intervention comprising \nboth early (at 18–20 weeks) and late scans (at 31–33 \nweeks).\nMaternal outcomes\nModerate-certainty evidence suggests that an early \nultrasound scan probably has little or no effect on \ncaesarean section rates (5 trials, 22 193 women; RR: \n1.05; 95% CI: 0.98–1.12).\nHowever, low-certainty \nevidence suggests that early ultrasound may lead \nto a reduction in induction of labour for post-term \npregnancy (8 trials, 25 516 women; RR: 0.59, 95% CI: \n0.42–0.83).\nRegarding maternal satisfaction, low-certainty \nevidence suggests that fewer women may report \nfeeling worried about their pregnancy after an early \nultrasound scan (1 trial, 635 women; RR: 0.80, 95%",

                "content": "Maternal outcomes\nAnaemia was reported in many different ways and \nat different time points during pregnancy and the \npuerperium. Low-certainty evidence shows that \ndaily iron supplementation may reduce the risk of \nanaemia at term (defined as blood Hb concentration \n< 110 g/L at 37 weeks of gestation or later) (14 trials, \n2199 women; RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46) and \nsevere postpartum anaemia (defined as Hb < 80 g/L) \n(8 trials, 1339 women; RR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01–0.28).\nLow-certainty evidence also shows that daily \niron supplementation may increase maternal Hb \nconcentrations at or near term (34 weeks of gestation \nor more) (19 trials, 3704 women; MD: 8.88 g/L \nhigher, 95% CI: 6.96–10.8 g/L) and may increase the \nproportion of women with a high maternal Hb at or \nnear term (Hb > 130 g/L at 34 weeks of gestation \nor later) (8 trials, 2156 women; RR: 3.07, 95% CI: \n1.18–8.02).\nRegarding maternal morbidity, moderate-certainty \nevidence shows that daily iron supplementation \nprobably reduces the risk of maternal puerperal \ninfections (4 trials, 4374 women; RR: 0.68, 95% CI: \n0.5–0.92). Low-certainty evidence shows that daily \niron supplementation may have little or no effect on \npre-eclampsia (4 trials, 1704 women; RR: 1.63, 95% \nCI: 0.87–3.07) and antepartum haemorrhage (2 trials, \n1157 women; RR: 1.48, 95% CI: 0.51–4.31), and \nmoderate-certainty evidence shows that it probably \nhas little or no effect on postpartum haemorrhage \n(4 trials, 1488 women; RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.59–1.49). \nEvidence on other morbidity outcomes, including \nplacental abruption and blood transfusions, is of very \nlow certainty.\nLow-certainty evidence shows that daily iron \nsupplementation may have little or no effect on \nmaternal mortality (2 trials, 12 560 women; RR: \n0.33, 95% CI: 0.01–8.19). Women’s satisfaction was \nevaluated in one small trial (49 women), which found \nlittle difference between daily iron and control groups.\nSide-effects: Moderate-certainty evidence indicates \nthat daily iron supplementation probably has little or \nno effect on the risk of experiencing any side-effect \n(11 trials, 2425 women; RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.83–2.02), \nand that it may have little or no effect on constipation \n(4 trials, 1495 women; RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.62–1.43), \nheartburn (3 trials, 1323 women; RR: 1.19, 95% CI: \n0.86–1.66) and vomiting (4 trials, 1392 women; RR: \n0.88, 95% CI: 0.59–1.30). Evidence that daily iron \nhas little or no effect on nausea is of low certainty \n(4 trials, 1377 women; RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.72–2.03). \nHigh-certainty evidence shows that diarrhoea is \nless common with daily iron supplements (3 trials, \n1088 women; RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32–0.93).\nFetal and neonatal outcomes\nLow-certainty evidence shows that daily iron \nmay reduce the risk of low-birth-weight neonates \n(< 2500 g) (11 trials, 17 613 neonates; RR: 0.84, 95%\n\nC.3: Antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis\nRECOMMENDATION C.3: Antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D immunoglobulin in non-sensitized \nRh-negative pregnant women at 28 and 34 weeks of gestation to prevent RhD alloimmunization \nis recommended only in the context of rigorous research.\n(Context-specific recommendation – \nresearch)\nRemarks\n•\nThis context-specific recommendation relates to anti-D prophylaxis during pregnancy and not the \npractice of giving anti-D after childbirth, for which there is high-certainty evidence of its effect of reducing \nRhD alloimmunization in subsequent pregnancies (129).\nAnti-D should still be given postnatally when \nindicated.\n•\nDetermining the prevalence of RhD alloimmunization and associated poor outcomes among women in \nLMIC settings, as well as developing strategies to manage this condition, is considered a research priority\n\nChapter 3.\nEvidence and recommendations \n67\nSummary of evidence and considerations\nEffects of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin \nprophylaxis in non-sensitized Rh-negative \npregnant  women compared with no intervention \n(EB T able C.3)\nThe evidence on the effects of antenatal anti-D \nprophylaxis was derived from a Cochrane review that \nincluded two RCT s involving over 4500 Rh-negative \npregnant women (138).\nMost participants were \nprimigravidas.\nBoth trials compared antenatal anti-D \nprophylaxis with no antenatal anti-D prophylaxis.\nOne \ntrial used a dose of 500 IU, the other used 250 IU, \ngiven at 28 and 34 weeks of gestation.\nData were \navailable for 3902 pregnancies, and more than half \nthe participants gave birth to Rh-positive newborns \n(2297).\nAll women with Rh-positive newborns \nreceived postpartum anti-D immunoglobulin as per \nusual management.\nThe primary outcome was the \npresence of Rh-antibodies in maternal blood (a proxy \nfor neonatal morbidity).\nNo maternal ANC guideline \noutcomes (including maternal satisfaction and side-\neffects) and few perinatal guideline outcomes were \nreported in these trials.\nFetal and neonatal outcomes\nEvidence on the effect of antenatal anti-D on RhD \nalloimmunization during pregnancy, suggesting \nlittle or no difference in effect, is very uncertain.\nIn \naddition, the evidence on the effect on postpartum \nRhD alloimmunization and alloimmunization up \nto 12 months postpartum among women giving \nbirth to Rh-positive newborns (n = 2297 and 2048, \nrespectively) is very uncertain, partly because events \nwere rare.\nEvidence on the effect of antenatal anti-D \non neonatal morbidity (jaundice) from one trial (1882 \nneonates) is also very uncertain, partly because \nevents were rare.\nNo other ANC guideline outcomes \nwere reported in the review.\n\nAdditional considerations\nnn Low-certainty evidence from the Cochrane review \nsuggests that Rh-negative women who receive \nantenatal anti-D are less likely to register a \npositive Kleihauer test (which detects fetal cells \nin maternal blood) during pregnancy (1 trial, 1884 \nwomen; RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41–0.88) and at the \nbirth of a Rh-positive neonate (1 trial, 1189 women;",

The strategy adopts a multi-pronged 6x6x6 \napproach to address both nutritional and non-nutritional anaemia through continuum of care. \nTypes of anaemia:\n1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, copper, \nselenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit. B12, Vit. B6)\n2. Non-nutritional Anemia: Due to haemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil \nTransmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and chronic diseases such as tuberculosis etc.\nMost common prevalent nutritional deficiency in India is iron deficiency anemia (50%)\nGrading of anaemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table below:\nPopulation Anemia\nMild Moderate Severe\nPregnant women 10.0-10.9gm/dl 7-9.9 gm/dl <7gm/dl\nNutritional anemia:\nThe cause, signs and symptoms of nutritional anemia is as under:\nTable 9: Causes, signs and symptoms of Nutritional Anemia\nCauses of nutritional anaemia:Signs and symptoms of anaemia:\n ∙ Inadequate intake of the dietary \niron\n ∙ Improper absorption of iron\n ∙ Loss of iron from the body\n ∙ Worm infestations\n ∙ Tiredness and weakness\n ∙ Breathlessness\n ∙ Pale face, nails, tongue and conjunctiva of eyes\n ∙ Lack of concentration\n ∙ Reduces capacity to work thus decreased productivity\n ∙ Limits learning ability\n ∙ Causes loss of appetite\n ∙ Affects the growth and development\n ∙ Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in immunity\n\n34\nNon-nutritional anemia:\nNon-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation and/or \nhaemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to haemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and \nthalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-nutritional anemia is a \ncommon finding. \nIn the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, along with \nscreening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis respectively.\nPrevention & Control of anaemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required nutrients \nto prevent nutritional anaemia.",

        "answer": "During your pregnancy, it's important to be aware of certain danger signs that could indicate potential complications. Based on the provided medical guidelines, here are the key danger signs you should monitor and report immediately if experienced:\n\n1. **Severe Abdominal Pain**: Any persistent or severe pain in the abdomen should be reported immediately.\n\n2. **Vaginal Bleeding**: Any occurrence of bleeding should prompt immediate medical attention. This is critical both in early and late stages of pregnancy.\n\n3. **Decreased or Absent Fetal Movements**: A noticeable decrease or sudden cessation of fetal movement can be a sign of fetal distress.\n\n4. **Leaking of Fluid**: Any leaking of watery fluid from the vagina could indicate premature rupture of membranes and should be reported immediately.\n\n5. **Severe Headache and Blurring of Vision**: These symptoms can be indicative of preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that requires immediate attention.\n\n6. **Persistent Vomiting**: While nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy, persistent or severe vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum) needs medical evaluation.\n\n7. **Fever**: A high fever during pregnancy could be a sign of an infection and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.\n\n8. **Swelling of Hands or Face**: Extreme swelling, especially if sudden, could also indicate preeclampsia.\n\n9. **Painful Urination or Reduced Urine Output**: These symptoms could suggest a urinary tract infection or other kidney-related issues.\n\n10. **Severe Itching**: Particularly in the later stages of pregnancy, severe itching can be a sign of obstetric cholestasis, a liver disorder.\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention. Early detection and management of complications can significantly improve outcomes for both you and your baby. Always consult with your healthcare provider for any concerns during your pregnancy.",

                "content": "The following are the signs of threatened abortion:\n ∙ There is light bleeding.\n ∙ The woman complains of lower abdominal pain.\n ∙ There is no history of expulsion of POC.\n ∙ Abdominal examination shows the uterus to be softer than normal, and the fundal height corresponds to the \nperiod of gestation.\n ∙ On P/V examination, the cervical os is found to be closed.\nManagement:\n ∙ If the bleeding decreases or stops, explain the facts to the woman, reassure her and advise her to go home \nafter you have checked her vital signs.\n ∙ Advise her to avoid strenuous exercise/work and to avoid sexual intercourse.\n ∙ Advise her to take bed rest.\n ∙ Send her to the MO with a referral slip for further advice.\nVaginal bleeding in late pregnancy (APH): \nThe most serious causes are placenta praevia (placenta lying at or near the cervix), abruptio placentae (detachment \nof the placenta before the birth of the foetus) or a ruptured uterus. Any bleeding (light or heavy) at this \ntime of pregnancy is dangerous.\nRemember:\nP/V should not be performed in women who have bleeding during pregnancy beyond 20 weeks.\nManagement:\nA woman with placenta praevia, abruptio placentae or ruptured uterus should not be managed at the SHC-HWC \nbecause there are no facilities for blood transfusion or surgical intervention, if required. Refer such a woman \nimmediately to an FRU equipped with facilities for surgical obstetrics, blood transfusion and anaesthesia after \nestablishing an intravenous line.\n2. Pregnancy Induced Hypertension\n ∙ PIH includes:\n ¾ Hypertension—systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 \nmmHg or more, on two consecutive readings taken four hours or more a part.\n ¾ Pre-eclampsia—hypertension with proteinuria\n ¾ Eclampsia—hypertension with proteinuria and convulsions\n ∙ Measure the woman’s blood pressure during every antenatal and postnatal visit. If it is high (more than \n140/90 mmHg), check it again after four hours. If the situation is urgent, the blood pressure should be \nmeasured after one hour.\n ∙ If the woman has hypertension, check her urine for the presence of proteins. The combination of a raised \nblood pressure and proteinuria is sufficient to categorise the woman as having pre-eclampsia.\n\n44\n ∙ Refer the woman to the 24x7 PHC/FRU so that she can receive anti-hypertensive medication. She should be \nmanaged at home as per the advice of the MO. \n ∙ Keep in touch with the woman or her family and undertake appropriate follow-up of these cases.",

Preventive measures\nRecommendation Type of \nrecommendation\nAntibiotics for \nasymptomatic \nbacteriuria (ASB)\nC.1: A seven-day antibiotic regimen is recommended for all pregnant \nwomen with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) to prevent persistent \nbacteriuria, preterm birth and low birth weight.\nRecommended\nAntibiotic \nprophylaxis to \nprevent recurrent \nurinary tract \ninfections\nC.2: Antibiotic prophylaxis is only recommended to prevent recurrent \nurinary tract infections in pregnant women in the context of rigorous \nresearch.\nContext-specific \nrecommendation \n(research)\nAntenatal anti-D \nimmunoglobulin \nadministration\nC.3: Antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D immunoglobulin in non-sensitized \nRh-negative pregnant women at 28 and 34 weeks of gestation to prevent \nRhD alloimmunization is only recommended in the context of rigorous \nresearch.\n\nEarly detection of \nfetal compromise could lead to timely clinical \ninterventions to reduce poor perinatal outcomes \nbut might lead to maternal anxiety or unnecessary \nclinical interventions.\nIt is also possible that the \nperiod between decreased fetal movements and \nfetal death might be too short to allow effective \naction to be taken (108).\nnn Symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurement: \nSFH measurement is a commonly-practiced \nmethod of fetal growth assessment that uses a \ntape measure to measure the SFH, in order to \ndetect intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).\nIt also has the potential to detect multiple \npregnancy, macrosomia, polyhydramnios and \noligohydramnios.\nFor fetuses growing normally, \nfrom 24 weeks of gestation, the SFH measurement \nin centimetres should correspond to the number \nof weeks of gestation, with an allowance of a 2-cm \ndifference either way (109).\nOther methods of fetal \ngrowth assessment include abdominal palpation of \nfundal height in relation to anatomical landmarks \nsuch as the umbilicus and xiphisternum, abdominal \ngirth measurement, and serial ultrasound \nmeasurement of the fetal parameters (109).\nAccurate low-cost methods for detecting abnormal \ngrowth are desirable because ultrasound, the most \naccurate screening tool, is resource-intensive and \nnot widely available in LMICs.\nnn Routine antenatal cardiotocography (CTG):  \nCTG is a continuous recording of the fetal heart \nrate and uterine contractions obtained via an \nultrasound transducer placed on the mother’s \nabdomen.\nCTG is widely used in pregnancy \nas a method of assessing fetal well-being, \npredominantly in pregnancies with increased risk \nof complications and during labour.\nnn Fetal ultrasound examination: Diagnostic \nultrasound examination is employed in a variety \nof specific circumstances during pregnancy, such \nas where there are concerns about fetal growth \nand after clinical complications.\nHowever, because \nadverse outcomes may also occur in pregnancies \nwithout clear risk factors, assumptions have been \nmade that antenatal ultrasound examination in \nall pregnancies will prove beneficial by enabling \nearlier detection of problems that may not be \napparent (110) – such as multiple pregnancies, \nIUGR, congenital anomalies, malpresentation \nand placenta praevia – and by allowing accurate \ngestational age estimation, leading to timely \nand appropriate management of pregnancy \ncomplications.\nnn Fetal Doppler ultrasound examination: Doppler \nultrasound technology evaluates umbilical artery \n(and other fetal arteries) waveforms to assess \nfetal well-being in the third trimester of pregnancy.\nIt is widely used in high-risk pregnancies to \nidentify fetal compromise and thus reduce \nperinatal mortality (111, 112).\nTherefore, it might \nalso be useful when performed as an antenatal \nintervention to detect fetal compromise and \npredict complications, particularly IUGR and \npre-eclampsia, in apparently healthy pregnancies.",

Most of the complications such as postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), sepsis, uterine \ninversion, amniotic fluid embolism  and eclampsia, which may lead to maternal mortality, occur \nduring this period. As per the WHO’s document on “recommendations on maternal and newborn \ncare for a positive postnatal experience” published in 2022, up to 30% of maternal deaths occur in \nthe post-natal period. \nObjective of Guidance note: This note is complementary to existing guidance and schemes by \nMoHFW and envisions to strengthen the quality of care in post-natal period.  \nTarget audience: Health care providers ( MO, CHO, SN, ANM, ASHA) and program managers \nat all levels. \nChallenges in existing Post-natal care (PNC) \nUnder Home based Newborn Care ( HBNC) programme, screening and referral of high -risk \npostnatal mothers is one of the important components. However, considering the huge number of \nmaternal deaths in the country, a significant proportion of which occurs in the post-natal period, it \nis imperative to address the challenges faced during the delivery of post-natal services. In order to \naddress these challenges, the following areas need reinforcement:  \n Quality screening during HBNC visits for identification of high-risk mothers and newborns \n Tracking and management of high-risk post-natal mothers including their follow up \n Adequate counseling of mother and her family members during post-natal period \n Regular consumption of IFA and Calcium supplementation \n Adequate monitoring and supervision by the field -level functionaries for the provision of \nPNC care & services   \nStrategies to Improve Post Natal Care",

Strong uterine contractions, both in number \nand duration; foetal distress and rapid maternal pulse. \n/circle6 Horizontal ridge across the abdomen, below the level of the umbilicus.\n/circle6 Transverse lie and abnormal presentations are commonly associated with obstructed \nlabour. All cases of obstructed labour require management at a referral centre. Refer the \nwoman immediately to an FRU.\n/circle6 Th  e following steps should be taken during transportation. \n/lozenge6 Establish an intravenous line and give fl uids at a moderate rate (30 drops per minute). \nIf you cannot establish an intravenous line, give the woman sips of sweet fl uids or \nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) to prevent hypoglycaemia and dehydration. Do \nnot give solid food as she may need surgery.\n/lozenge6 Give the woman the fi rst dose of antibiotics (ampicillin capsule, 1 g orally; Metronidazole \ntablet, 400 mg orally; and Gentamicin injection, 80 mg intramuscular stat).\n/lozenge6 Ensure that you or any other health worker, who has suffi  cient knowledge and skills \nrelated to labour and delivery, accompany the woman to the FRU.\nProlapsed cord\nProlapsed cord is the condition in which the umbilical cord lies in the birth canal below \nthe foetal presenting part, or is visible at the vagina following rupture of the membranes. \nTh  is is associated with foetal distress and can lead to death of the foetus because of an \nobstruction of the blood fl ow to the foetus from the placenta. \n/circle6 Th  e foetal outcome is poor in cases of prolapsed cord. Th e family should be counselled \nand the woman referred to the FRU as early as possible.\n/circle6 When delivery is imminent, be prepared to resuscitate the newborn and also, to refer \nthe woman and infant to the FRU.\nRetained placenta and placental fragments\nTh e placenta is said to be retained if it is not delivered within half an hour of the birth of \nthe baby. \nBleeding may or may not occur in cases of retained placenta.\nA partially separated placenta or retained placental fragments cause continuous vaginal \nbleeding, leading to PPH. Manage such cases as in the case of PPH. \n/circle6 If the placenta is already separated and is lying in the birth canal, then remove it gently.\n/circle6 If it is not separated, refer the woman immediately to the FRU for manual removal of the \nplacenta. Do not attempt to undertake this procedure.",

Services Initiative’ aims to create a cadre \nof Nurse Practitioners in Midwifery who are skilled in \naccordance to ICM competencies, knowledgeable and \ncapable of providing compassionate women-center, \nreproductive, maternal and newborn health care services \nand also develop an enabling environment for integration \nof this cadre into the public health system, in order to \nachieve the SDGs for maternal and newborn health.\nWhat is positive childbirth \nexperience?\nA positive childbirth experience is defined \nas one that fulfils or exceeds a woman’s \nprior personal and sociocultural beliefs and \nexpectations, including giving birth to a healthy \nbaby in a clinically and psychologically safe \nenvironment with continuity of practical and \nemotional support from a birth companion(s) \nand kind, technically competent clinical staff.\nIt \nis based on the premise that most women want \na physiological labour and birth, and to have \na sense of personal achievement and control \nthrough involvement in decision-making, even \nwhen medical interventions are needed or \nwanted.\n(WHO)\nObjectives\n Ķ\nTo p rovide access to quality maternal and \nnewborn health services and promote natural \nbirthing by promoting positive child birthing \nexperience\n Ķ To promote respectful maternity care throughout \npregnancy and child birth\n Ķ To identify, manage, stabilize and/or refer as \nneeded, women and their newborns experiencing \ncomplications\n Ķ To decongest higher level of healthcare facilities\n Ķ To expand access to quality maternal and neonatal \nservices in remote areas including pockets of high \nhome delivery rates and urban slums\n\n10\nGUIDELINES ON MIDWIFERY SERVICES IN INDIA\nBroad Principles of the Midwifery Initiative\n 1.\nHow midwifery services will be organized\n Ķ Midwifery services must first operationalized within the public health system and these guidelines must \nbe used for integrating midwifery cadre into the public health system\n Ķ Midwifery care will be integrated through the introduction of Midwifery-led Care Units, to be established \nat selected LaQshya certified high case load public health facilities.",

A pregnant woman with \nsymptoms of hypothyroidism, a history of hypothyroidism, or with other endocrine system conditions or \nhigh-risk pregnant woman should be screened for hypothyroidism.\n ∙ ASHA/ANM will identify pregnant women at risk for hypothyroidism and refer to SHC-HWC and counsel \nthem for timely testing and follow up. You should make sure that periodic visits are made as per schedule by \nPW diagnosed with hypothyroidism and that there are no dropouts.\n ∙ You should inform PHC-MO, in case a pregnant woman who has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism is \nmoving out of the area, a detailed report should be given to her regarding the management plan so that she \nis able to follow up and continue her treatment wherever she goes.\nBreast examination: \n ∙ Observe the size and shape of the nipples for the presence of inverted or flat nipples. Try and pull out the \nnipples to see if they can be pulled out easily. If the nipples are inverted, the woman must be advised to pull \non them and roll them between the thumb and index finger.\n ∙ A 10cc or 20cc disposable plastic syringe can also be used for correcting inverted nipples. Cut the barrel of \nthe syringe from the end where the needle is attached. Take out the plunger and put it in from the opposite\n\n23\nend, which is the cut end of the syringe. Push the piston forward fully, and gently place the open end of \nthe barrel in such a way that it encircles the nipple and areola. Pull back the plunger, thus creating negative \npressure. The nipple will be sucked into the barrel and pulled out in the process.\n ∙ Look for crusting and soreness of the nipples. If these are present, the woman must be advised on breast \nhygiene and the use of emollients such as milk cream.\nThe breasts must be palpated for any lumps or tenderness. If there are lumps or tenderness, \nrefer the woman to the MO.",

        "answer": "For proper development of the baby during pregnancy, the following foods are recommended based on the provided medical guidelines:\n\n1. **Essential Fatty Acids**: Include a variety of cooking oils like mustard oil, groundnut oil, soybean oil, and coconut oil. Also, consume nuts, oilseeds, and fish which are sources of 'good fat'. Avoid 'bad fat' like vanaspati, margarine, and reused oil. These fats are crucial for the baby’s brain and vision development.\n\n2. **Protein Sources**: For non-vegetarians, meat, eggs, chicken, and fish are excellent sources of protein, vitamins, and iron. These nutrients support the overall growth of the baby and help prevent anemia.\n\n3. **Calcium-Rich Foods**: Include milk, curd, paneer, ragi, sesame seeds, almonds, soya milk, turnip, and eggs in your diet. Calcium is vital for the baby's bones and teeth development.\n\n4. **Iron and Folate**: Continue consuming one folic acid tablet (400 mg) daily along with dietary sources like catla fish, moth beans, kidney beans, soybean, spinach, sem ki phali, sarson ka saag, and chicken liver. These are important for the normal development of your baby's brain and spinal cord.\n\n5. **Variety of Foods**: A well-balanced diet consisting of a variety of local seasonal foods, vegetables, and fruits is emphasized to ensure comprehensive nutrient intake.\n\nThese recommendations are derived from the medical guidelines provided in the context documents, which emphasize the importance of a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients for the healthy development of the baby during pregnancy.",

Most of the complications such as postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), sepsis, uterine \ninversion, amniotic fluid embolism  and eclampsia, which may lead to maternal mortality, occur \nduring this period. As per the WHO’s document on “recommendations on maternal and newborn \ncare for a positive postnatal experience” published in 2022, up to 30% of maternal deaths occur in \nthe post-natal period. \nObjective of Guidance note: This note is complementary to existing guidance and schemes by \nMoHFW and envisions to strengthen the quality of care in post-natal period.  \nTarget audience: Health care providers ( MO, CHO, SN, ANM, ASHA) and program managers \nat all levels. \nChallenges in existing Post-natal care (PNC) \nUnder Home based Newborn Care ( HBNC) programme, screening and referral of high -risk \npostnatal mothers is one of the important components. However, considering the huge number of \nmaternal deaths in the country, a significant proportion of which occurs in the post-natal period, it \nis imperative to address the challenges faced during the delivery of post-natal services. In order to \naddress these challenges, the following areas need reinforcement:  \n Quality screening during HBNC visits for identification of high-risk mothers and newborns \n Tracking and management of high-risk post-natal mothers including their follow up \n Adequate counseling of mother and her family members during post-natal period \n Regular consumption of IFA and Calcium supplementation \n Adequate monitoring and supervision by the field -level functionaries for the provision of \nPNC care & services   \nStrategies to Improve Post Natal Care",
