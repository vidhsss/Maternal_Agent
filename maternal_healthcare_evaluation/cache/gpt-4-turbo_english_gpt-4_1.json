    "justification": "The response covers the most critical advice for a pregnant person concerned about fetal movements. However, it could be improved by including specific guidance on how to monitor fetal movements (e.g., kick counts) and what constitutes a significant decrease in movements. Additionally, mentioning the typical timeframe when movements become more regular (usually around 28 weeks) would provide more context.",

  "response": "It's normal to occasionally not feel your baby move, especially earlier in pregnancy when movements can be less noticeable. However, if you notice a significant decrease in your baby's movements or if movements stop, this could be a sign of a serious complication. It's important to monitor the baby's movements, especially as you get further along in your pregnancy.\n\nIf you're concerned about the frequency or pattern of your baby's movements, it's best to contact your healthcare provider immediately for further advice. They can perform checks to ensure everything is progressing well with your pregnancy. Remember, it's always better to be cautious and seek advice if you're unsure or worried.",
