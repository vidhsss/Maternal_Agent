    "justification": "While the response covers important causes of bleeding in early pregnancy and the crucial advice to seek medical attention, it does not mention other possible causes of bleeding later in pregnancy, such as placenta previa, placental abruption, or the onset of labor. Including information about when bleeding might be considered more normal, such as very light spotting in early pregnancy, could also be helpful.",
