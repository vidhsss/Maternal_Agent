    "justification": "While the response covers the critical aspect of monitoring fetal movements and when to seek medical advice, it lacks specific guidance on what constitutes a 'significant decrease' in movements, which could be crucial for a pregnant person to understand. Additionally, it does not mention the concept of 'kick counts,' a common method used to monitor fetal health.",

  "question": "Sometimes I don\u2019t feel the baby\u2019s move ..is it okay or something else?",
  "response": "It's normal to occasionally not feel your baby move, especially earlier in pregnancy when movements can be less noticeable. However, if you notice a significant decrease in your baby's movements or if movements stop, this could be a sign of a serious complication. It's important to monitor the baby's movements, especially as you get further along in your pregnancy.\n\nIf you're concerned about the frequency or pattern of your baby's movements, it's best to contact your healthcare provider immediately for further advice. They can perform checks to ensure everything is progressing well with your pregnancy. Remember, it's always better to be cautious and seek advice if you're unsure or worried.",
