  "response": "Prickly heat and itching are common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes and increased sweating. Here are a few tips to help manage the discomfort:\n\n1. Keep the affected area cool and dry. Try to stay in cooler environments and avoid excessive heat.\n2. Wear loose, breathable clothing made from natural fibers like cotton, which allows your skin to breathe and reduces irritation.\n3. Bathe in cool water and use a mild soap that is gentle on the skin.\n4. You can apply a calamine lotion or an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to soothe itching. However, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider before using any medications.\n5. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, as this helps to regulate your body temperature.\n\nIf the itching is severe, widespread, or accompanied by other symptoms like jaundice, it's important to consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation. Remember, it's always best to seek personalized advice from your healthcare provider regarding any health concerns during pregnancy.",
