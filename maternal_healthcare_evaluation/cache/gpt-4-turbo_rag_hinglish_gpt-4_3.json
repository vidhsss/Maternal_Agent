  "question": "mujhe thyroid h to kya isse bhi breast milk pe asar hota h",
  "response": "Mujhe aapke sawaal ka jawab dene ke liye di gayi jaankari mein koi seedha sandarbh nahi mila hai ki thyroid ki samasya se breast milk par kya asar padta hai. Yeh zaroori hai ki aap apne healthcare provider se is vishay mein vistar se baat karein, kyunki ve aapki personal medical condition ko samajhne mein madad kar sakte hain aur sahi salah de sakte hain. Thyroid ki samasyaon ka ilaaj aur unka prabandhan zaroori hai, aur yeh aapke overall swasthya aur breastfeeding ke anubhav par asar daal sakta hai. Kripya apne doctor se sampark karein taaki aapko sahi margdarshan mil sake.",
