  "question": "Kya pregnancy m bleeding hoti h kya yeh normal h",
  "response": "Pregnancy m bleeding hoti h kya yeh normal h\n\nPregnancy m bleeding hoti h, lekin yeh normal nahin h. Pregnancy m bleeding hoti h, jise threatened abortion ya incomplete spontaneous abortion kaha jata hai. Yeh bleeding light hoti h, aur yeh pregnancy ke 20 week tak hoti h. Agar bleeding heavy hoti h, ya uterine tenderness hoti h, to yeh incomplete spontaneous abortion ho sakta hai. Agar bleeding light hoti h, aur uterine tenderness nahin hoti h, to yeh threatened abortion ho sakta hai.\n\nYadi aapko pregnancy m bleeding hoti h, to aapko apne doctor se baat karni chahiye. Unhone aapki pregnancy ki jaanch ki hogi, aur unhone aapko pata chalega ki aapki pregnancy m bleeding kitni normal hai. Agar aapki pregnancy m bleeding heavy hoti h, ya uterine tenderness hoti h, to aapko hospital mein le jaana pad sakta hai.\n\nYadi aapko koi dusri samasya hai, to aap mujhe puch sakte hain.
