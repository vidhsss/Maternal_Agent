  "response": "Mangoes can be consumed during pregnancy, but it is important to maintain a balanced diet and not consume too much of any one food. Mangoes are rich in vitamins A and C, but they also contain natural sugars. It is recommended to eat at least 3 main meals and 2 nutritious snacks daily, including a variety of fruits and vegetables. However, if you have any concerns about your diet during pregnancy, it is always best to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.",
