  "question": "My baby weight is 452 gram in 22weeks..is this normal",
  "response": "Based on the information provided, I don't have specific guidelines regarding fetal weight at 22 weeks to determine if 452 grams is within a normal range.

They can provide you with the best advice and care. Remember, regular prenatal check-ups are crucial for monitoring the health and development of your baby. If you have any concerns about your pregnancy, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider.",
