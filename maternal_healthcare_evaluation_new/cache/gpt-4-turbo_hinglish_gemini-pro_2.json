    "justification": "While it emphasizes the importance of seeking medical attention for bleeding during pregnancy, it omits crucial information about what kind of bleeding is considered an emergency (heavy bleeding, clots, severe pain) and what kind might be less urgent (spotting). It also doesn't mention the possibility of normal implantation bleeding in early pregnancy, which could reassure some women.",

    "justification": "The language is generally understandable for a Hinglish speaker, but medical terms like 'threatened abortion,' 'spontaneous abortion,' 'ectopic pregnancy,' and 'hydatidiform mole' are presented without further explanation. This could be confusing for someone with average literacy.  Simpler explanations or translations would improve clarity."

  "cultural_appropriateness": {
    "score": 2,
    "justification": "Using Hinglish is appropriate for the target audience. However,  considering the cultural context of Assam, where access to healthcare might be limited in certain areas, the response could be improved by including advice on reaching out to local health workers like ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) in addition to doctors.  This would acknowledge potential barriers to accessing formal medical care and offer a more practical solution."
