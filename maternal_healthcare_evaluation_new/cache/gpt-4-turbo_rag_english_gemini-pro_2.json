    "justification": "While the advice is generally applicable, knowing the user is from Assam, India, a region known for its hot and humid climate, the response could be strengthened.  Mentioning readily available local remedies or acknowledging the specific climatic challenges in that region would improve cultural relevance.  For example, suggesting the use of loose cotton clothing is good, but in Assam, specific traditional garments are worn that are naturally breathable, and mentioning those could be helpful.  Also, access to air conditioning might not be universal, so suggesting alternative cooling strategies relevant to the region would be beneficial."
