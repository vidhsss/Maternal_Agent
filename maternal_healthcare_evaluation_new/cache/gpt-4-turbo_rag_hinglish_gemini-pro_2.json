It also doesn't mention the importance of noting the color, amount, and any associated symptoms.",

      "Bleeding can occur in the later stages of pregnancy due to conditions like placenta previa or placental abruption, which are serious and require immediate medical attention.",

    "justification": "The language is generally understandable for a Hinglish speaker, but medical terms like 'threatened abortion,' 'spontaneous abortion,' 'ectopic pregnancy,' and 'hydatidiform mole' might be confusing for someone with average literacy.  Simpler terms or explanations would improve clarity."

  "cultural_appropriateness": {
    "score": 2,
    "justification": "Using Hinglish is appropriate for the target audience. However, considering the cultural context of Assam, where access to healthcare might be limited in certain areas, the response could be improved by emphasizing the importance of seeking help even in remote areas and suggesting potential resources if available.  Also, directly translating medical terms instead of using simpler language can be a barrier."
