  "question": "My baby weight is 452 gram in 22weeks..is this normal",
  "response": "I don't have enough information to answer this question based on the provided guidelines. The provided context only mentions the weight of the baby at 22 weeks, which is 452 grams. However, it does not provide information on the expected weight range for a 22-week-old baby. To determine if the weight is normal, you would need to consult a healthcare provider or refer to a reliable source of fetal growth charts. They can provide personalized guidance on fetal growth and development.",
