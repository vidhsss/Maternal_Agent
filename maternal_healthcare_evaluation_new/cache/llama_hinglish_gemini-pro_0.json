    "justification": "While the use of Hinglish is appropriate, understanding the cultural context of Assam, India, could improve the response. Mangoes are a staple in many Indian diets. Acknowledging this and providing more specific advice related to mango consumption in pregnancy, while still recommending a doctor consultation, would be more culturally relevant. For example, mentioning the different varieties of mangoes available in Assam and their varying sugar content could be helpful."
