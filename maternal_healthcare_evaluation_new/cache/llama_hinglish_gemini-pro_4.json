    "justification": "While the AI acknowledges the user's lack of vomiting, it fails to address the underlying concern:  A pregnant person might worry if they *aren't* experiencing common symptoms.  It also focuses too much on severe vomiting and misses an opportunity for more helpful advice.",
    "missing_information": [
      "Reassurance that not all pregnant individuals experience all symptoms, and lack of vomiting at 2.5 months can be normal.",
      "Information about expected symptoms at 2.5 months (e.g., breast tenderness, fatigue, mild nausea) and advice to consult a doctor for any concerns or unusual changes."

    "justification": "The language is generally understandable, but the repetitive and unnecessary inclusion of postpartum information makes the response confusing and less clear.  The AI also keeps mentioning unspecified \"guidelines.\" This is unhelpful and adds to the lack of clarity."

    "justification": "The use of Hinglish is appropriate, demonstrating an attempt to communicate in the user's language. However, simply acknowledging the user's language isn't enough.  There's no consideration for potential cultural nuances related to pregnancy in Assam, India.  For example, dietary advice or common remedies used in that region could be relevant and helpful."
