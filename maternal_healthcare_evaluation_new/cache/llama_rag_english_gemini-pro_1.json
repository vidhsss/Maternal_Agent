    "justification": "While the language itself is appropriate, there's no consideration for the user's location in Assam, India. Access to healthcare can vary significantly within India, and acknowledging this would improve the response.  For example, providing information about local resources or acknowledging potential barriers to accessing care would be beneficial."

However, it does mention that newborns normally move their arms or legs or turn their head several times in a minute. If you are concerned about the baby\u2019s movement, I would recommend consulting a healthcare provider for personalized advice. They can assess the baby's overall health and provide guidance on any concerns you may have.",
