    "justification": "While deferring to a doctor is generally appropriate, acknowledging the cultural context of mango consumption in Assam (and India more broadly) would improve the response. Mangoes are a popular and readily available fruit, so briefly mentioning their general nutritional value while still emphasizing the importance of personalized medical advice would be more culturally relevant."
