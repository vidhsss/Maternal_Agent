    "justification": "While the response correctly identifies bleeding during pregnancy as not normal and mentions threatened and incomplete abortion, it oversimplifies these conditions and makes some inaccurate claims.  It incorrectly states bleeding related to these conditions only occurs up to 20 weeks. It also ties light bleeding to threatened abortion and heavy bleeding to incomplete abortion, which is an oversimplification.  Many other conditions can cause bleeding, and the amount of bleeding doesn't definitively diagnose the cause.",

    "justification": "The Hinglish used is generally understandable, but the repetitive phrasing and lack of clear structure make it less clear than it could be.  Simplifying the language and using clearer explanations would improve understanding."

  "cultural_appropriateness": {
    "score": 2,
    "justification": "Using Hinglish is appropriate for the target audience. However, the response lacks sensitivity regarding the potential anxiety and fear associated with bleeding during pregnancy.  A more empathetic and reassuring tone would be more culturally appropriate, especially considering the context of Assam, India, where access to healthcare might be challenging for some."

Pregnancy m bleeding hoti h, jise threatened abortion ya incomplete spontaneous abortion kaha jata hai. Yeh bleeding light hoti h, aur yeh pregnancy ke 20 week tak hoti h.
