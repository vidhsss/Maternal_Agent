    "justification": "Most claims are correct, such as vomiting being common in pregnancy and the need to consult a doctor if it's severe. However, the repeated and unnecessary mention of guidelines not covering this topic is misleading.  The AI seems to be hallucinating these restrictive guidelines.  Management of vomiting in pregnancy *is* covered in standard maternal care guidelines.",

    "justification": "While the AI correctly advises seeking medical attention for severe vomiting, it fails to address the user's core concern: lack of nausea/vomiting at 2.5 months. This could be normal or indicate a problem. The response also focuses heavily on *severe* vomiting, neglecting milder cases.",

      "Reassurance that lack of nausea/vomiting at 2.5 months can be normal for some women.",

    "justification": "The language is generally understandable but repetitive and overly focused on the nonexistent guideline limitations. This makes the core message less clear. The constant referral to postpartum care is also confusing, given the user's stated gestational age."

    "score": 2,
    "justification": "The use of Hinglish is appropriate, acknowledging the user's language preference. However, it lacks specific cultural sensitivity relevant to Assam, India.  Understanding potential cultural nuances around pregnancy and healthcare-seeking behavior in that region could improve the response.  For example, acknowledging that some women may have limited access to healthcare or face cultural barriers to seeking it would be beneficial."
