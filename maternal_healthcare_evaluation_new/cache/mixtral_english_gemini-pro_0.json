However, the AI ignores the provided context (22 weeks and 452g) and doesn't address the actual question of whether this is normal.  At 22 weeks, 452g is around the expected weight, but this crucial information is missing.",

    "justification": "The response fails to address the core question about the fetal weight at 22 weeks. It provides generic information about low birth weight, which is irrelevant in this context. It also doesn't acknowledge the possibility of miscarriage/preterm birth risks.",
    "missing_information": [
      "A 452g fetal weight at 22 weeks is approximately within the normal range, although individual variations exist.  Confirmation with an ultrasound is crucial.",
      "At 22 weeks, the pregnancy is still considered preterm, and delivering a baby at this stage carries significant risks.  Close monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential."

    "justification": "The language is understandable, but the response starts with \"I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about your baby's weight or gestational age.\" This is confusing since the user *did* provide that information.  This makes the AI seem unreliable."

  "cultural_appropriateness": {
    "score": 2,
    "justification": "While the language is generally appropriate, there's no specific cultural sensitivity demonstrated for a user from Assam, India. Access to healthcare and cultural perceptions around pregnancy can vary significantly in that region. Encouraging a consultation with a local healthcare provider familiar with the specific context would improve cultural appropriateness."

  "question": "My baby weight is 452 gram in 22weeks..is this normal",
  "response": "I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about your baby's weight or gestational age. However, I can tell you that a birth weight of less than 1500 grams is considered low birth weight and may require special care. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and monitoring. They can assess your baby's health and provide appropriate guidance.",
