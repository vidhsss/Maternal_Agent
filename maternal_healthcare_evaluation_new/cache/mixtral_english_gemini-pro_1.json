    "justification": "While the advice to consult a healthcare provider is crucial, it lacks specific guidance on what constitutes a 'significant decrease' in fetal movement.  This can be subjective and leave the patient unsure when to seek help. It also doesn't mention how to monitor movements (e.g., kick counts).",

      "Information on how to monitor fetal movements (e.g., kick counts -  choosing a time of day when the baby is usually active, lying down on their side, and counting how long it takes to feel 10 movements.  If it takes longer than two hours, they should contact their healthcare provider).",
      "More specific guidance on what constitutes a 'significant decrease.'  For example, 'less than 10 movements in two hours' or 'a noticeable change from the baby's usual pattern of movement.'"

    "justification": "While the advice is generally appropriate, being from Assam, India, could mean limited access to healthcare, cultural beliefs about pregnancy, or language barriers.  Acknowledging these potential challenges and suggesting resources (if available) would improve cultural sensitivity.  For example, mentioning the local equivalent of a healthcare provider (e.g., ASHA worker) could be helpful."

  "response": "It's normal for the baby's movements to vary from time to time. However, if you notice a significant decrease in your baby's movements or if you haven't felt any movement for a while, it's important to consult your healthcare provider. They can check your baby's heartbeat and make sure everything is okay. It's always better to be safe and seek medical advice when it comes to your baby's health.",
