    "justification": "The AI completely failed to address the user's Hindi query.  It did not respond in Hindi, and more importantly, it missed the critical contextual clue about the user's advanced pregnancy stated in Hindi.  This demonstrates a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding of the user's situation.  In many cultures, including parts of India, discussing pregnancy openly might be less common, so relying on the user's provided information is crucial."
