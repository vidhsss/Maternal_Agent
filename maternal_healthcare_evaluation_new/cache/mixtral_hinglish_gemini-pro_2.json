    "justification": "While mostly correct, the response oversimplifies threatened abortion. It describes the cervix beginning to open, which isn't always the case.  Also, stating it's 'not usually a serious condition' can be misleading. While many threatened abortions resolve without issue, it *can* be serious and requires monitoring to ensure the pregnancy continues safely.  The advice to seek medical attention for heavy bleeding or severe pain is absolutely correct.",

    "justification": "The response addresses common concerns about bleeding during pregnancy but omits crucial information. It lacks specific guidance on when to seek immediate care (e.g., soaking through a pad per hour) and doesn't mention other causes of bleeding like ectopic pregnancy or placental problems.  It also doesn't mention the importance of Rh factor incompatibility.",

      "Specific guidance on the amount of bleeding that warrants immediate medical attention (e.g., soaking a pad an hour).",
      "Mentioning other potential causes of bleeding, such as ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, or placental abruption, even if just briefly to encourage seeking medical advice."

    "justification": "The language is generally understandable for an average hinglish speaker. However, medical terms like 'threatened abortion' might be confusing and could benefit from further simplification or explanation. Using simpler terms like 'khatra garbhpat' or 'garbh giraane ka khatra' could be more accessible."

  "cultural_appropriateness": {
    "score": 2,
    "justification": "The response is generally acceptable. However, considering the cultural context of Assam, India, where access to healthcare can be challenging, emphasizing the importance of seeking medical advice even for seemingly minor bleeding could be beneficial. Additionally, acknowledging potential barriers to accessing care and suggesting resources available in Assam would improve cultural appropriateness."

  "question": "Kya pregnancy m bleeding hoti h kya yeh normal h",
  "response": "Bleeding during pregnancy can be normal, but it can also be a sign of a problem. If you are experiencing bleeding, it is important to pay attention to the amount and color of the blood, as well as any other symptoms you may be having. In early pregnancy, light bleeding with lower abdominal pain could be a sign of a threatened abortion, which is when the cervix begins to open but the pregnancy is not expelled. This is not usually a serious condition, but it is important to be monitored by a healthcare provider. If you have heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately. It is always best to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.",
