    "justification": "The AI acknowledges the lack of vomiting, which is the user's main concern. However, it incorrectly downplays the significance of this by saying it's \"not a specific step\" needed for safety.  It also states that vomiting is \"useful\" in pregnancy, which is misleading. While some nausea/vomiting can be normal, it's not inherently beneficial or necessary.",

    "justification": "The use of Hinglish is appropriate for the target audience. However, the lack of specific, helpful information and the slightly dismissive tone regarding the absence of vomiting might not be well-received.  More empathetic and informative language would be better.  No specific cultural nuances related to Assam are addressed, which would improve the response."

Garbhaalamban mein vomiting kaam aata hai, lekin iska koi sthaayi nahi hai. Agar aapko vomiting ya koi anya problem hai to aap apne swasthya karyakarta se salah lena chahte hain.",
