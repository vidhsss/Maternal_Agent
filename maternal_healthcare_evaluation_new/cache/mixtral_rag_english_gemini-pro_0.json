    "justification": "The statement about low birth weight being under 1500g is correct. However, the AI ignores the provided context (22 weeks and 452g) and doesn't address the actual question of whether this is normal.  At 22 weeks, 452g is indeed below the expected weight, making the general statement about 1500g at birth somewhat misleading in this specific context.",

    "justification": "The response fails to address the core question about fetal weight at 22 weeks. It provides a general statement about low birth weight but doesn't offer specific information relevant to the user's situation.",
    "missing_information": [
      "A 452g fetal weight at 22 weeks is significantly below the expected range and requires immediate consultation with a doctor.  Further investigations are needed to determine the cause and potential implications.",

    "justification": "The language is generally understandable, but the response starts with \"I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about your baby's weight or gestational age.\" This is confusing since the user *did* provide that information. This makes the subsequent advice seem less relevant and personalized."

  "cultural_appropriateness": {
    "score": 2,
    "justification": "While the language itself is appropriate, the response lacks sensitivity to the potential anxiety a user might experience when facing a possible complication with their pregnancy.  Acknowledging the user's concern and providing more reassuring and actionable advice would be more culturally appropriate, particularly in a context like Assam, India, where access to healthcare might vary and cause additional stress."

  "question": "My baby weight is 452 gram in 22weeks..is this normal",
  "response": "I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about your baby's weight or gestational age. However, I can tell you that a birth weight of less than 1500 grams is considered low birth weight and may require special care. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and monitoring. They can assess your baby's health and provide appropriate guidance.",
