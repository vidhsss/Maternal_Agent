  "response": "It's normal for the baby's movements to vary from time to time. However, if you notice a significant decrease in your baby's movements or if you haven't felt any movement for a while, it's important to consult your healthcare provider. They can check your baby's heartbeat and make sure everything is okay. It's always better to be safe and seek medical advice when it comes to your baby's health.",
