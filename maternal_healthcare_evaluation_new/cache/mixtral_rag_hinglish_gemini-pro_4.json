However, it incorrectly downplays the significance of this by saying it's \"not a specific step to stay safe.\"  While lack of vomiting isn't inherently dangerous, it doesn't guarantee safety, and the AI misses the opportunity to address potential underlying concerns.",

    "justification": "The language is mostly understandable, but phrases like \"surakshit rahne ke liye koi khas kadam nahi lena chahta hai\" are awkwardly phrased and could be confusing.  \"Garbhaalamban mein vomiting kaam aata hai\" is also unclear and potentially misleading."
