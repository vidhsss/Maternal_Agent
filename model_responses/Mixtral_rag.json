These foods should include a variety of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and dairy products. You should also ensure that your baby gets vaccinated on time. It is important to take your baby to the nearest health center for immunization. At 4 months, your baby will receive the following vaccines: DPT, Hepatitis B, and OPV.

In this case, I would recommend trying some non-pharmacological options to help relieve your nausea.\n        Firstly, you can try increasing your intake of food and fluids in smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. It is also important to avoid any taboos in your community that may exist against nutritionally healthy foods.\n        Talking to your family members, such as your husband and mother-in-law, can also be helpful in ensuring that you are eating enough and avoiding any heavy physical work.\n        In addition, there is some low-certainty evidence that suggests ginger may help relieve symptoms of nausea and vomiting. You can try consuming ginger in the form of supplements or adding it to your food or tea.\n        However, it is important to note that pharmacological treatments, such as doxylamine and metoclopramide, should be reserved for those pregnant women experiencing distressing symptoms that are not relieved by non-pharmacological options, under the supervision of a medical doctor.\n        I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",
