Response,gpt,"Folic acid is a very important vitamin, especially during pregnancy. It's a form of vitamin B9 that helps prevent birth defects in the baby's brain and spine, known as neural tube defects. These defects can include conditions like spina bifida (where the spine doesn't form properly) and anencephaly (where major parts of the brain and skull don't develop).",
,,,
,,"Taking folic acid before and during early pregnancy helps ensure that the baby's neural tube, which becomes the brain and spinal cord, develops correctly. It's recommended that women who are planning to become pregnant or are in the early stages of pregnancy take a daily supplement of folic acid. This is because the neural tube develops very early in pregnancy, often before many women even know they're pregnant.",
,,,
,,"Additionally, folic acid also helps the body make new cells, including red blood cells, which is important for both the mother and the baby. This can help prevent another type of birth defect known as cleft lip and palate, and it also supports the overall growth and development of the fetus.",
,,,
,,"The typical recommendation is to take 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day, starting at least one month before becoming pregnant and continuing through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Some women might need a higher dose if they have a history of neural tube defects in previous pregnancies or other specific health conditions. It's always a good idea to discuss with a healthcare provider to ensure the right dosage and to address any other health considerations during pregnancy.",

,,"Folic acid is a type of B vitamin that is very important for the health of a mother and her baby during pregnancy. It helps in the formation of the neural tube, which eventually becomes the baby's brain and spine. If the neural tube does not form properly, it can lead to serious birth defects of the brain and spine called neural tube defects. ",
,,,
,,"Folic acid also helps the body make new cells and can prevent changes to DNA that may lead to cancer. It is found in foods such as leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, and peas. However, it is difficult to get the required amount of folic acid from food alone, especially during pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that all women of reproductive age take a daily folic acid supplement of 400 to 800 micrograms, and women who are planning to become pregnant should start taking folic acid supplements before they become pregnant.

,,"It's important to note that folic acid is water-soluble, which means it is not stored in the body and needs to be replenished daily. So, it's crucial to take it every day. ",

It helps to prevent birth defects of the brain and spine, called neural tube defects. It is recommended that women take a daily dose of 400 μg folic acid, starting before conception and continuing through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
