Nausea and vomiting are common in pregnancy, often referred to as morning sickness, but many women might have mild symptoms or none at all. As long as you are attending your regular prenatal check-ups and your healthcare provider confirms that your pregnancy is progressing well, there is usually no need to worry. If you have any concerns about your symptoms or lack thereof, it's always a good idea to discuss them with your doctor.",
