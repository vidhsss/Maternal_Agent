,,"        To keep your baby healthy when he is 4 months old, you should continue breastfeeding him exclusively for the first six months. This means that no other liquid, including water, should be given to the baby during this time. After six months, you can start giving him complementary foods along with breastfeeding. These foods should include a variety of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and dairy products. You should also ensure that your baby gets vaccinated on time. It is important to take your baby to the nearest health center for immunization. At 4 months, your baby will receive the following vaccines: DPT, Hepatitis B, and OPV. You should also continue taking your IFA and calcium tablets as prescribed by your healthcare provider. These tablets are important for your baby's proper growth and development. If you are not taking the pill, you should use a suitable family planning method to avoid pregnancy. Spacing of at least 3 years is desirable to allow you to restore your health and to avoid malnutrition in children due to repeated pregnancies. Family planning methods are available free of cost at any public health facility. You should consult with your husband and choose a suitable family planning method after delivery.",
