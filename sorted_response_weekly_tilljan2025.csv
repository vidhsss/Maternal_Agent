34_uninitialized," Medication Abortion or medical abortion (MA) is a safe and legal option for women to end early pregnancy (under 9 weeks). 

MA is different from surgical abortion as there's no surgery or hospitalisation needed for the woman. 

Women have to take a pack of pills prescribed by the doctor that will help end the pregnancy 💊👩🏽‍⚕️ Whether you are just curious about this topic and want general information, or whether you/your partner are dealing with an unplanned pregnancy and need a solution, I can provide guidelines for both situations 🙂

Also, to reassure you, whatever information I share with you is accurate and trustworthy as it has been checked by India's medical experts 👩🏽‍⚕️ While some people buy the abortion pills from their local pharmacy, Indian law requires a doctor's prescription to buy it!   

Visiting a doctor is helpful as they will check if there are any health conditions before taking the pills.
